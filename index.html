											<h2>About me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Gaming is a very big passion of mine and have used this as my drive to help me learn more about
								           game development in University. Having done an  A-Level in computer science learning python, this helped
								           me to quickly grasp the basics of c++ and c# which I have been learning since the start of my University course at
								           Staffordshire University. As a third year student I am now looking for a graduate to help improve my skills and knowledge in terms of
								           programming and game development knowledge as well as start a career within the games industry

                                         Used to create a chat service using loopback traffic as network and for Unity projects
                                         developing an understanding of multithreading alongside potential issues such as deadlocks animated
                                         the difficulties of managing and debugging code. I also learned the basics of networking such as show

                                         good coding practice. Also have an understanding of what pointers are, what they do and different types of

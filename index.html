											<h2>About me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Gaming is a very big passion of mine and have used this as my drive to help me learn more about
								           game development in University. Having done an  A-Level in computer science learning python, this helped
								           me to quickly grasp the basics of c++ and c# which I have been learning since the start of my University course at
								           Staffordshire University. As a third year student I am now looking for a graduate to help improve my skills and knowledge in terms of
								           programming and game development knowledge as well as start a career within the games industry

                                         Used to create a chat service using loopback traffic as network and for Unity projects
                                         developing an understanding of multithreading alongside potential issues such as deadlocks animated
                                         the difficulties of managing and debugging code. I also learned the basics of networking such as show
                                         data is transfered across a network and the different protocols used for this.

                                         Used in projects utilising SDL and S2D frameworks learning the basics of c++ includiing
										 loops, pointers, conditions. Developed further when using OpenGL learning more about coding standards, 
                                         good coding practice. Also have an understanding of what pointers are, what they do and different types of
                                         pointers within c++.

										 the use of nav meshes to aid with enemy AI

                                           through rendering objects to a scene set up in OpenGL but later changing to develop a game. The biggest issue was loading fbx models
                                           into the scene however after taking a quick course on using blender the knowledge of object data helped to solve this issue.

                                        <p style="font-size: 18px">This project was developed in a team of 6 in which I was responsible for the players movement, animations and implementing an aim down sight system.
                                           With the movement system being fairly straight forward the highlights for me on this project were the animations and the aim down sight system.
                                           The aim down sight system was based around offsetting the gun towards the camera based off the distance away from a socket on the gun. The animation system
                                           utilised events and notifies with Unreals aniamtion blueprint and animation instance to provide functionality to help with melee combat.
